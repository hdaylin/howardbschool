                   <h3>BARRON H. HARVEY</h3>
                            <p>Under the distinguished leadership of Barron H. Harvey, Ph.D. the Howard University School of Business continues to make strides in its ongoing quest to maintain
                            excellence in its academic programs. For the 2nd Year in a row, the School’s Undergraduate Program was ranked among the Top 75 US programs in Business Week’s 2008 “Best
                            Undergraduate B-Schools”. It was among the top 20 schools in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, 1 of 4 in the Washington DC Metro-Area and the only Historically
                            Black University to be included in the ranking. In the September 2007 Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive Survey of corporate recruiters on business schools, the
                            School’s MBA program maintained its ranking as one of the top three national institutions for hiring minority graduates. Additionally, the 2007 Princeton Review, again
                            ranked the MBA Program among the top business schools in the nation, #1 ranking for the Greatest Opportunity for Minority Students and #5 ranking for Most Competitive
