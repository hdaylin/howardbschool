##Getting started 
  After checking out the repository and familiarizing yourself with it, you are ready to go. The easiest way to get started is to visit the issues page and pickup something to work on. You can contact me to get some help started or bounce some ideas off me. Once you are done, you can simply close the issue. You may also create a new issue if you see something wrong while you are working.

##Pushing code
  Since we have so many people working on this project, we want to be very careful we pushing our changes such that we do not step on each other's toes (e.g. throwing away all the work someone else did). We also want to have a certain level of oversight to make sure everything is done properly. 
  
  As a result, I urge you not to push to the master branch. Instead you should create a branch for your changes and commit you changes to that branch. Once I double check your code, I will personally merge it to make sure that nothing goes wrong. You can create and push to branch like this:
  ~~~
  $ git checkout -b simeon_homepage_work  
  #or some other descriptive name
  
  $ git commit -m 'added a new footer [issue 53]'

  $ git push -u origin simeon_homepage_work
  ~~~
