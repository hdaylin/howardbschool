##Welcome!
  Thank you for taking the time to work on this project. To get started, simply request to be a collaborator and I will approve it. This will allow you to push code to the repository.

##Pushing code
  Since we have so many people working on this project, we want to be very careful we pushing our changes such that we do not step on each other's toes (e.g. throwing away all the work someone else did). We also want to have a certain level of oversight to make sure everything is done properly. 
  
  As a result, I urge you not to push to the master branch. Instead you should create a branch for your changes and commit you changes to that branch. Once I double check your code, I will personally merge it to make sure that nothing goes wrong. You can create and push to branch like this:
  ---
  $ git checkout -b simeon_homepage_work  
  #or some other descriptive name
  
  $ git commit -a -m 'added a new footer [issue 53]'
  ---
